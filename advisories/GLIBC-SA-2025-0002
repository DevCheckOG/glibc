elf: static setuid binary dlopen may incorrectly search LD_LIBRARY_PATH

A statically linked setuid binary that calls dlopen (including internal
dlopen calls after setlocale or calls to NSS functions such as getaddrinfo)
may incorrectly search LD_LIBRARY_PATH to determine which library to load,
leading to the execution of library code that is attacker controlled.

The only viable vector for exploitation of this bug is local, if a static
setuid program exists, and that program calls dlopen, then it may search
LD_LIBRARY_PATH to locate the SONAME to load. No such program has been
discovered at the time of publishing this advisory, but the presence of
custom setuid programs, although strongly discouraged as a security
practice, cannot be discounted.
